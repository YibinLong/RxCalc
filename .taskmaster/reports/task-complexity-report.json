			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Fetch NDC Data from FDA API",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the task into API call implementation, response parsing, and error handling.",
			"reasoning": "Fetching data from an external API requires handling network requests, parsing complex data structures, and implementing error handling. The complexity is moderate to high due to these factors."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Quantity Calculation Logic",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the task into parsing SIG, calculating quantities, and selecting NDC combinations.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves complex logic to parse and calculate quantities based on user input. The complexity is high due to the need for accurate parsing and calculation logic."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Design Output Display",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Separate the task into designing the UI layout and implementing data export functionality.",
			"reasoning": "Designing a UI for displaying data involves creating a clear and intuitive layout and ensuring data is presented accurately. The complexity is moderate due to the need for a user-friendly design and additional functionality like data export."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Error and Notification Handling",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the task into implementing error highlighting and notification system integration.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves implementing a notification system and handling errors gracefully. The complexity is moderate due to the need for effective user feedback mechanisms."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Logging and Debugging",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the task into implementing logging and setting up performance monitoring.",
			"reasoning": "Setting up logging and debugging is straightforward but requires careful configuration to ensure useful output. The complexity is moderate due to the need for structured logging and performance monitoring."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Deploy to Google Cloud Run",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Separate the task into configuring the environment, deploying the application, and testing the deployment.",
			"reasoning": "Deployment involves configuring the environment, deploying the application, and ensuring everything runs smoothly. The complexity is increased by the need for correct configuration and testing in a production environment."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Conduct End-to-End Testing",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the task into automated testing setup, manual testing, and user feedback collection.",
			"reasoning": "End-to-end testing is complex due to the need to cover all application workflows and ensure comprehensive test coverage. It requires both automated and manual testing, increasing the complexity."
